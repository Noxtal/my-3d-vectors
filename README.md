A simple Rust 3D vector library for solving Codewars' ["Program a Calculator #2 - 3D Vectors"](https://www.codewars.com/kata/58ee4962dc4f81d6f400001c) by [donaldsebleung](https://www.codewars.com/users/donaldsebleung). I'm putting this out there to make sure I remember I did that as it may come handy later! Cool feature: float precision is handled using an epsilon of 0.000001 by default.

Note: uses (x, y, z) notation except for the statically-declared unit vectors i, j and k.
